## Intelligent Multimedia Information Retrieval System
The feature of detecting when the users upload files that contain adult material is something that has been needed since the beginning of social networks where everyone can upload whatever they want without having in count that there might be children's watch that. So, we have developed a system that classifies an adult content based on text, speech and image. Text classification is implemented using text pre-processing methods. Speech recognition is done using PyAudio library and Google’s speech recognizer whereas age and nudity detection is done using pre-trained deep convolution neural network which proves to be a state-of-art. The ‘Bad Bad Words’ data set is used to identify the bad words in speech, text and the ‘Adience’ data set is used in age detection model. The system is implemented using Django framework which provides database support to store the audio and image files uploaded by users.
